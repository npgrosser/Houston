Houston is a [context aware](#user-content-context) AI Assistant for your Terminal.
He translates your instructions, written in plain English, into Bash (or PowerShell) scripts.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Git (git binary must be in your PATH for the ez-install script to work)
- JDK 11 or higher

### Linux and Mac

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npgrosser/Houston/master/scripts/ez-install.sh | sh

### Windows

    powershell -Command "& { (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npgrosser/Houston/master/scripts/ez-install.ps1') | Invoke-Expression }"

## Usage

_hu_ (/Ëˆhju:/) is Houston's nickname and the default command for working with him. It allows you to give Houston
an instruction in natural language.

    hu <instruction>

See `hu ---help` for all available options.

The OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable must be set to your OpenAI API key.   
You can get one at [https://beta.openai.com/](https://beta.openai.com/).

_Instead of using the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable, you can also specify the key in your config file.
See [Configuration](#user-content-configuration) section for more information._

### Examples:

- `hu run ubuntu container with interactive bash`
- `hu find all pdf files in my home directory`
- `hu delete unused docker images and networks`
- `hu tell me a dad joke`

### Context

To give Houston the best chance of completing tasks, it's important to provide relevant context.  
This may include details about the file tree, contents of specific files, installed packages, your bash history etc.   
For this purpose, there are some features that help you do this.

#### Context Flags

The easiest way to provide context is to make use of one of the predefined context flags:

```
Options:
  -f PATH     Provide file name and its content as context information
  -t          Provide current file tree as context information
  -td INT     Maximum depth of the file tree (unlimited if not explicitly set)
  -r TEXT     Run the command and provide the output as context information
```

See `hu ---help` for all available options.

##### Examples

    hu check which of the project requirements are not meat by my system -f README.md

    hu build and install the project -f README.md

    hu write a rap song about Houston -f README.md

    hu tell me what kind of project this is -t -td 1

#### Context Files

Another, more powerful way to provide context information is to use _context files_.
Theoretically, you could also use them to mimic the functionality of the context flags.
A context file is a file with a '.ctxt' extension that contains a list of information in plain english.

##### Default Context File

The  _~/houston/default.ctxt_ file is used by default.
This is the context file that you would use to let Houston know about your individual preferences and requirements.
For example, which package manager you prefer, what your favorite language is, what you like him to call you, etc.
Use it to fine tune Houston to your needs.

##### Named Context Files

Named context files are context files that you can enable per instruction.
They are useful for providing context information that is specific to a certain task.
As the default context file, they are located in the _~/houston_ directory.
You enable them by using the `-c` flag.

    hu <instruction> -c <context-file-name>

_Simple example:_

###### ~/houston/pretty-output.ctxt:

    - when printing to the terminal, always use capital letters and colored output.

_Usage:_

    hu print hello world -c pretty-output

Per instruction you can enable multiple context files.

    hu <instruction> -c <context-file-name-1> -c <context-file-name-2>

##### Directory Context Files

Directory context files are context files that are located in a directory and are automatically enabled for all
instructions given in that directory or any of its subdirectories.
Both 'houston.ctxt' and '.houston' are valid names for directory specific context files.

For security reasons, you have to explicitly trust directories to allow Houston to use their context files.
You do this by adding the directory to the _~~/houston/trusted_dirs_ file (using glob patterns).

_Example content of ~/houston/trusted_dirs:_

    /home/user/my-name
    /home/user/my-name/my-projects
    /home/user/my-name/my-projects/**

#### Dynamic Context using Command Variables

Context files are not just simple text files.
They are templates that can be filled with dynamic information using _command variables_.
You can make use of them by using the '${cmd}' syntax in your context files.
These command variables will be evaluated on each instruction and replaced with the output of the command.

Here is an example of a Context File using command variables:

    - The current working directory is ${pwd}.
    - The current user is ${whoami}.
    - The current time is ${date}.

When this template is processed, the resulting output would look similar to this:

    - The current working directory is /home/user/nico/houston.
    - The current user is joe.
    - The current time is 2020-10-10 12:00:00.

When writing your own context files, keep in mind that all the data will be sent to OpenAI.
Therefore, you should only use commands that do not reveal sensitive information.

##### Using arguments in context files

When using a named context via the -c flag, you can also pass arguments.
For example:

    hu tell me a joke -c lang:german

Arguments are passed to the template, where you can access it as you would do with any normal shell script.
Example:

~/houston/lang.ctxt:

    - When printing to the terminal, always use the ${echo $1} language.

_Keep in mind that we need to use the echo command here because command variables are replaced with the output of the
command_

If you want to pass multiple arguments, you just need to make sure to add quotes around the _context spec_.

    hu tell me a joke -c "langs:german english french"

---

_Note that the above example assumes that Bash is used as the shell to evaluate the command variables._     
_When using a different shell, you might need to use a different syntax to access the arguments._   
_For example, in Powershell, you would use the $args variable. Also, you would not need to use the echo command._

    - When printing to the terminal, always use the ${$args[0]} language.

##### Examples

Here are a few more examples of named context files to give you an idea of how they can be used.

###### git.ctx

A context file that adds the current git status as context information.

    - The current git status is:
    ```
    ${git status}
    ```

###### docker.ctx

A context file that adds the current docker status as context information.

    - The current docker status is:
    ```
    ${docker ps -a}
    ```
    - The current docker images are:
    ```
    ${docker images}
    ```

###### history.ctx

A context file that adds the last n (default 10) commands from your bash history as context information.

    - The last ${1:-10} commands I ran were:
    ```
    ${tail -n ${1:-10} ~/.bash_history | cut -d ';' -f 2-}
    ```

###### env.ctx

A context file that adds the current environment variables as context information.

    - The current environment variables are:
    ```
    ${env}
    ```

###### file-tree.ctx

A context file that adds the current file tree as context information.

    - The current file tree is:
    ```
    ${tree -L ${1:-3}}
    ```

### Debugging

If you want to see what is actually passed to the API, you can use the `--debug` flag.    
This is especially useful if you want to see how your context files are evaluated.

### Configuration

See _~/houston/config.yml_ file for available configuration options.
It is automatically created when you run `hu` for the first time.

### Tips

- Keep your context files small. The GPT-3 models are limited in the number of tokens per request. Try to only add the
  information
  that is really necessary. Especially the -c flag feature is meant to help you with this by providing a way to choose
  the relevant context information for each request.
- You can use command variables to embed context files in other context files.
  E.g. (`${cat ~/houston/maven.ctxt && cat ~/houston/git.ctxt}`)
- If you use Houston a lot, you might want to check https://beta.openai.com/account/usage from time to time.
- Tools like [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
  or [PSReadLine](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/psreadline-2-2-6-enables-predictive-intellisense-by-default/)
  will make it easier for you to work with Houston.
