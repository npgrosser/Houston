Houston is a [context aware](#user-content-context) AI Assistant for your Terminal.
He translates your instructions, written in plain English, into Bash (or PowerShell) scripts.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Git (git binary must be in your PATH for the ez-install script to work)
- JDK 11 or higher

### Linux and Mac

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npgrosser/Houston/master/scripts/ez-install.sh | sh

### Windows

    powershell -Command "& { (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npgrosser/Houston/master/scripts/ez-install.ps1') | Invoke-Expression }"

## Usage

_hu_ (/Ëˆhju:/) is Houston's nickname and the default command for working with him. It allows you to give Houston
an instruction in natural language.

    hu <instruction>

See `hu ---help` for all available options.

The OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable must be set to your OpenAI API key.   
You can get one at [https://beta.openai.com/](https://beta.openai.com/).

_Instead of using the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable, you can also specify the key in your config file.
See [Configuration](#user-content-configuration) section for more information._

### Examples:

- `hu run ubuntu container with interactive bash`
- `hu find all pdf files in my home directory`
- `hu delete unused docker images and networks`
- `hu tell me a dad joke`

### Context

To give Houston the best chance of completing tasks, it's important to provide relevant context.  
This may include details about the file tree, contents of specific files, installed packages, your bash history etc.   
For this purpose, there are some features that help you do this.

#### Context Flags

The easiest way to provide context is to make use of one of the predefined context flags:

```
Options:
  -f PATH     Provide file name and its content as context information
  -t          Provide current file tree as context information
  -td INT     Maximum depth of the file tree (unlimited if not explicitly set)
  -r TEXT     Run the command and provide the output as context information
```

See `hu ---help` for all available options.

#### Examples using context flags:

    hu check which of the project requirements are not meat by my system -f README.md

    hu build and install the project -f README.md

    hu write a rap song about Houston -f README.md

    hu tell me what kind of project this is -t -td 1

#### Context Files

Another, more powerful and reusable way to provide context information is to use _context files_.
Theoretically, you could also use them to mimic the functionality of the context flags.

You can define directory specific _context files_ or global context files to describe additional requirements or
information in plain
english.
These will automatically be added as context information for every request.
Supported file names for directory specific context files are 'houston.ctxt' and '.houston'.
You can use both of them in the same directory.
_Per convention, the '.houston' file is meant for local use only and should not be committed to version control._

For security reasons, you have to explicitly trust working directories by adding them to the
~/houston/trusted_dirs file (using glob patterns).

Example content of ~/houston/trusted_dirs:

    /home/user/my-name
    /home/user/my-name/my-projects
    /home/user/my-name/my-projects/**

__

Example houston.txt file content

    - When printing to the terminal, always use capital letters and exclamation marks. 
      This is the only way to get my attention.

Think twice before adding a directory to the trusted_dirs file!
Arbitrary commands could be executed just by talking to Houston in that directory.

When a working directory is not trusted, the context files in it will just be ignored and a warning will be printed.
Besides that, you can still use Houston as usual in that directory.

#### Global context files

You can also create a _~/houston/default.ctxt_ file which will always be used, no matter what directory you
are in. It does not need to be trusted explicitly.
This is the context file that you would use to let Houston know about your individual preferences and requirements.
For example, which package manager you prefer, what your favorite language is, what you like him to call you, etc.
Use it to fine tune Houston to your needs.

Similar to the default.ctxt file, you can create arbitrary default files for specific contexts in the ~/houston/
directory.
The only difference to the default.ctxt file is that you have to explicitly enable them for each request by using the -c
flag.
You can use as many custom ctxt files as you want per request.

Example:

~/houston/pretty-output.ctxt:

    - when printing to the terminal, always use capital letters and colored output.

~/houston/maven.ctxt:

    - this working directory is a maven project

Usage:

    hu add jackson as a dependency -c maven -c pretty-output

#### Dynamic Context using Command Variables

_Context files_ also support command variables, which allow you to add dynamic data.
You can make use of them by using the following syntax: ${cmd}.
These command variables will be evaluated on each request.

Here is an example of a Context File using command variables:

    - The current working directory is ${pwd}.
    - The current user is ${whoami}.
    - The current time is ${date}.

When this template is processed, the resulting output would look similar to this:

    - The current working directory is /home/user/nico/houston.
    - The current user is nico.
    - The current time is 2020-10-10 12:00:00.

##### Using arguments in command variables

When using a named context via the -c flag, you can also pass arguments.
For example:

    hu tell me a joke -c lang:german

Arguments are passed to the template, where you can access it as you would do with any normal shell script.
Example:

~/houston/lang.ctxt:

    - When printing to the terminal, always use the ${echo $1} language.

_Keep in mind that we need to use the echo command here because command variables are replaced with the output of the
command_

If you want to pass multiple arguments, you just need to make sure to add quotes around the _context spec_.

    hu tell me a joke -c "langs:german english french"

---

_Note that the above example assumes that Bash is used as the shell to evaluate the command variables._     
_When using a different shell, you might need to use a different syntax to access the arguments._   
_For example, in Powershell, you would use the $args variable. Also, you would not need to use the echo command._

    - When printing to the terminal, always use the ${$args[0]} language.

### Debugging

If you want to see what is actually passed to the API, you can use the `--debug` flag.    
This is especially useful if you want to see how your context files are evaluated.

### Configuration

See _~/houston/config.yml_ file for available configuration options.
It is automatically created when you run `hu` for the first time.

### Tips

- Keep your context files small. The GPT-3 models are limited in the number of tokens per request. Try to only add the
  information
  that is really necessary. Especially the -c flag feature is meant to help you with this by providing a way to choose
  the relevant context information for each request.
- You can use command variables to embed context files in other context files.
  E.g. (`${cat ~/houston/maven.ctxt && cat ~/houston/git.ctxt}`)
- If you use Houston a lot, you might want to check https://beta.openai.com/account/usage from time to time.
- Tools like [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
  or [PSReadLine](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/psreadline-2-2-6-enables-predictive-intellisense-by-default/)
  will make it easier for you to work with Houston.
